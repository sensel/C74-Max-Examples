#Spectral Shiatsu

This Max project is for creating a unique audio instrument using the Sensel Morph contact data. This is ultimately rendered as a Max for Live device, but the 
bulk of the development is done in Max, using this project. This way, you can easily use the project in Max, where you may want to integrate it with other cool stuff.

The idea of this instrument is to generate a frequency plot (spectogram) from a sound or image. Using the Morph, you can use contacts and pressure to "reveal" 
different parts of the spectogram. There are various controls to shape your touches, change how sound is played back, and limit the area of the spectrograph you are 'touching.'
