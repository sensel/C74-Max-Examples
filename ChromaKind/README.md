#ChromaKind
This Max project was used to created realtime animations for a promotional video. An example is [here](https://youtu.be/m5euqiQ_4xk).
It combines video input, video input manipulated with shaders, a graphic waveform generated from audio input, graphics generated from touches on the Sensel Morph,
and real time chroma keying.

We have a [video guide](https://youtu.be/233wrx2DJ9E) that explains this patch on our YouTube channel. 

This also makes use of the `disable serial block` executables in our [API examples](https://github.com/sensel/sensel-api/tree/master/sensel-install/disable-serial-executables).

It's all a bit complicated, but it's super cool!
